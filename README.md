# Practice

Phone_cipher/dupes.txt contains a list of all the words from words.txt, that 
encode to the same thing using a simple phone cipher. Approximately 50K duplicates encoded words.

Phone_cipher/encode.pl is the perl script I used to do the encoding. very quickly
done code.

Phone_cipher/duplicates.pl is the perl script I used to find the duplicates, barely works :)

Phone_cipher/Words.txt is the list of the english words that I used for encoding 
and looking for duplicates
